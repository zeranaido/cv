      <p> <em>Future Software Engineer. </em> </p>
      <p> I'm an incoming 2nd year computer science student. My goals for this year is to self study programming and learn how to do front end development while studying.
        I aspire to be a skilled software engineer in the future to build unique websites and softwares throughout my journey. A lot of things happened to me that prevents
        me from chasing my dreams to become a software engineer, there's this time that I feel like I am losing interest anymore in my passion, but now I am back on my track
        and hopefully I will stay motivated throughout this year of learning.
